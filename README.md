This project is about making a recipe. This document will contain a brief description of the following by the end of this project:

1) Skill that I have demonstrated
Ordered and unordered lists
hyperlinking
getting images from the internet
git add and git commit and lastly git push

2) Self reflection over what I have learnt

I forgot to git push. That caused me to panic a bit over my git skills. I still feel shaky about it but overall its alright. Ill practice it a but more. I should get a hang of it.

HTML part was easy enough. I didn't struggle much with it. It was pretty straightforward. Im excited about making these websites look cool
